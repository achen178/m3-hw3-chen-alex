## Issues
* Ran into issues with Namespaces and Accesors. Errors were showing up in the Koala compiler. Searched the internet so similar issues and figured out that the issue was from not properly typing my css as opposed to the namespace syntax
* A few issues trying to get containers to work -- specifically full width backgrounds, but contained content. Solution was to incorporate more divs
* Had trouble creating the dim opacity overlay.
